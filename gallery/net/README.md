**"This Is Us"**<br>
Our project was the Data as Self Portrait option. The index page showed happier photos of ourselves, that are actually our social media image icons in real life. Once you click on our @ signs it takes you to a social media like format pages that show what we look at on the Internet and expresses how we feel about ourselves.

Within my net art project I wanted to combine two ideas, Early internet memories and Data as a self portrait. the first half of my website mimics earlier online games I used to play when I was younger. The second half is who I am on the internet and how I use it. these two concepts are a reflection of me and what my interests are.

This is a ode to my favorite animal of all time. Granted, my coding skills may not be the best, I am happy that I was still able to capture the importance this animal has in my life and hopefully yours too.

**My Story**<br>
I'm doing a combination of Data as Self Portrait and Fictional Chat Room. The concept is about my story when I got asked by a lot of people whether I'm Thai or Filipino? They even said that I don't look Vietnamese to them. Whenever I heard all of that, I just proudly answered them that "I'm Vietnamese."

The concept behind this chatroom is the anonymity of the internet, along with the ability to connect to someone across the entire world. We never really know who we are talking to and in modern times, many more people are willing to live online as real life. What I mean by this is that we trust people online with information even among the anonymous nature of the internet.

**Bookmark Self Portrait**<br>
This work was inspired by Evan Roth's Internet Cache Self Portrait Series. Instead of my internet cache history, I am using every bookmark I have saved. The collection of bookmarks (about 150 in total) of my most visited and favorite sites is interesting visual language for describing my digital self. Creating an interaction between a photo of my physical self and the collage portrait of bookmarks makes a dynamic self portrait.
