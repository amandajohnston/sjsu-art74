  <p>Our art pieces follow the theme of outer space. I always thought it be interesting to create a piece of art in which the inhabitants of a planet can visibly see outer space and not just see planets as stars.Â  In order to create this piece of art, I started off by searching for images of outer space with planets, grass and an ant. After that I cut out the unnecessary parts from the images (the background) and used the stamp tool in Photoshop to make the ant and grass seem more natural and blend together. The title of my piece is 'Planet Insect'.</p>
