# Critiques
Critiques are not optional! They are an important part of your participation grade.

**How and why do I critique others’ work?**

* A critique is a chance to give critical feedback and let the artist know how others view and interpret their work. It is extremely rare to have a room full of people paying attention to your work, especially after school.


* It is not a personal judgement

* You are critiquing the work not the person- Keep it neutral, respectful and constructive

* As the artist, this is a time to take responsibility for what you have made and understand how your work is perceived by others.

* When critiquing, are going beyond ‘I Like’ and providing a description, analysis, and interpretation of what you see.

**Guiding Questions** <br>
* **Description:** What do you see? Are there relationships between the images?
* **Formal Analysis:** Why are you noticing what you notice? Is it line, shape, color, contrast? <br>
* **Interpretation:** How are you interpreting what you see. What do you think the pieces mean? Why do you think so? How does it make you feel? Why does it do that? What does it make you think of?  Another artist, idea, concept- anything from the world. Let the artist know where your mind goes when you look at their work.<br>
* **Questions:** What open question does the work suggest to you? (state it in positive or neutral terms - no negatives) (open questions have more than one right answer) <br>
* What do you wonder about? (state it in positive or neutral terms - no negatives)<br>
* Where could you see this work?  <br>

**Guidelines**

* **Be present** at everyone else’s critiques. Do not be late to critique.

* Set number of minutes per person, including critique and then response

* We’ll start with a moment to look at the work, then begin critique, then finish with the artist response (unless otherwise determined).

* Keep the discussion on topic, neutral, and respectful. Feel free to politely disagree with the Professor and other students – this is a discussion and art is subjective.


* **Participate!** Critiques are just as much for those providing feedback as those receiving it. Forming your thoughts about the work of others is essential to developing critical thinking and understanding art. Those who don’t participate may be called on.

* **Step Up/ Step Back:** “Participants should be aware of how much they are speaking. If they feel they are speaking a lot, they should let others speak, and if they find themselves not talking, they should try to contribute some comments, ideas or suggestions.” **Think of something to say for everyone's critique.**

* Don’t be afraid of silent pauses- people are just thinking.
