**Assignments Breakdown**

**Participation**<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
Participation consists of student engagement in class time- showing up to class on time, completing reading and response assignments, being active in class discussions and lectures, paying attention and speaking up in class critiques, and engaging and supporting your classmates in their projects and ideas. **Asking questions, contributing your thoughts, contributing to group projects, and being a positive part of the class community is essential to the success of this course.**

**In-Class Exercises and Readings**<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
There will be regular technical exercises completed in class over the course of the semester. There will also be occasional readings to supplement course material. Completion of these in-class exercises and responses to readings is essential to learning the skills necessary to complete the class projects. Understand these are **_in-class exercises_**. Extra work will be required to complete them outside of class, and might result in a grade deduction.

**Glitch Art project**<br>
_5% of grade_<br>
Using the idea of interruption, turning images inside out, and working with errors, create a glitch using Audacity and Photoshop. Begin with one image and deconstruct and manipulate the file to express a new perspective, using new aesthetics that convey conceptual ideas.

**Composite Art project**<br>
_5% of grade_<br>
Using at least three different sources, create a digital composite speculative protest poster in Photoshop and Illustrator. When making your source selections, think not only about what you are choosing, but where it comes from, and how that affects the meaning of the image and message. Think about the function of your image- Will it be printed large or small? Made into a sticker Shown static on a screen? Projected?

**Audio/Video Art project **<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
Using original audio recorded in class as your starting point, create a 1-2 minute video using your original footage that explores unexpected opposites. Explore camera placement, video editing, and adding visual effects. During class, on campus, shoot video footage using either a professional camera or your phone. What kind of art do you want to create and how will angles, speed, and sequencing demonstrate your idea in a way that written language and speech cannot?  

**Net Art project**<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
Use HTML and CSS to create a net art piece that consists of at least two pages and engages contemporary discourse in a poetic way. Incorporate hyperlinks and think about how you can create a non-linear narrative experience.

**Code as Art project**<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
Drawing with Code: Working from the idea that code is a language that does what it says, write a piece of working code using using the free resource p5 software to create an interactive experience that pays homage to a digital invention.

**Online Portfolio & Statement**<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
Building on the skills that you developed in the Net Art assignment, create an online portfolio in GitHub for the work completed in this class, including an artist statement page.

**New Media Artist Presentation**<br>
_10% of grade_<br>
Over the course of the class there will be regular lectures on New Media artists and movements, in addition to select readings on the subject of digital media art. For the New Media Artist presentation, each student will select an artist from a list provided and create a 10 minute presentation on their work and their place in the overall field of New Media Art, considering what we have covered in class and what they discovered in their research.

**Final project and Artist Statement**<br>
_20% of grade_<br>
Create a work of digital media art using the ideas and techniques you learned in Art 74. Final projects will be presented in-class in physical and/or virtual form. When you turn in your project, include a 2-page PDF paper including a 1-page artist statement plus a 1 page research statement that addresses your technical process, influences, and conceptual/theoretical process, development, and interests.
