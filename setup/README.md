# Equipment Checklist for Art 74

* **Notebook/Sketchbook **: Students are required to have a notebook or sketchbook for class. This will be used for taking notes during lectures and sketching or outlining ideas for assignments.   This is _for your benefit_. Studies show that note taking by hand has [been proven to help your brain work better and retain more information](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away).
<br>
<br>
* **Computer Access **: Students are encouraged to have a laptop for this course that [meets system requirements for operating Adobe Premiere Pro](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html). If no laptop is available, students may use the lab computers.   Please see me with questions.
 <br>
<br>
* **External or Cloud Storage (Thumb Drive or Hard Drive)**: It is important to back up your work! It's a terrible experience to lose something that you have worked hard on because your computer unexpectedly crashes. Save yourself from this nightmare with either an external device (thumb drive or hard drive), or setup cloud storage (icloud, dropbox, Google drive, etc.). Especially if you are using the lab computers.
<br>
<br>
* **Mobile device with recording capability**: We will be recording sound and video, and you can use the basic components of your mobile device for this. If you do not have a mobile device with recording capabilities, there are items available for check out with the school.
<br>
<br>
* **SJSU Library Card **: Students are required to get a [SJSU library card](https://library.sjsu.edu/borrow-renew-return/library-account) and a pin number. The card is necessary for access to [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) tutorials and free admission to museums we will visit. When you get the card, make sure you get the pin number so that you can use the benefits.
