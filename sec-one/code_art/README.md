**p5 Overload**<br>
This project first started as me interpreting my frustration with my laptop breaking time and time again. Here is the long story short during class on 4/22/2019 in the middle of coding my computer crashed and my screen cracked. So this concept is about my frustration and also exploration with coding.

**Choose the Right Colors: A Game by Hector Mendoza**<br>
The concept for my project was to create a simple game that anyone could play. When I first started using the internet, the way I got introduced was through simple online flash games which I got hooked on. The games were always easy to play and understand, and were never too heavy. Today, I find it hard to find games like these again, in fact the only games that seem to become popular are the complete opposite: heavy on your computer, complicated, and way too long. Choose the Right Colors was a way for me to relive the same excitement I had for these online mini-games, but in the present.

**Spider Solitaire**<br>
 For this Code as Art project, I was inspired by a photo that I took last year of a spiderweb. It reminded me of how my 94 year old grandma plays the game, Spider Solitaire, everyday on a laptop. It is her only interaction with a computer. She doesn't venture any further into the internet, but this singular relationship with this laptop has helped her mind stay extremely sharp throughout the years. I wanted pay homage to my grandma's love for this game, but also make it fun, interactive, and a little creepy by adding a lot of spiders to the piece while clicking down. I used interactive techniques from the p5js site to utilize different tracking speeds of the spiders in relationship to the mouse.

 **Calm the Vampire**<br>
In this piece, the user first sees an image of an angry Chinese vampire in front of a creepy forest. But when the site is clicked, there is a yellow talisman on the vampire and the vampire calms down and the background changes to a bright forest. In Chinese culture, when a talisman is placed on the forehead of the vampire, it will calm down. Through this piece, I experimented with the "if, else statement," the "mouseIsPressed" code, "function preload," and cursor design.

**Impending Doom**<br>
In light of the new Avengers Endgame movie, this piece is paying homage to the previous Avengers film Avengers Infinity War. The concept is life and death and how it can all end in a snap. We were instructed not to use recognizable characters, so we used images to represent the fallen heroes with animal based names. The images include a spider for Spider-Man, a black panther for Black Panther, a mantis for Mantis, and a falcon for Falcon. The infinity stones are rapidly bouncing around the screen to represent the chaos they create in the movie.

**Apple Makes Me Happy**<br>
 I wanted to explore the concept that apple products, or just any modern technology in general, makes people happy since we basically live online and how real life is considered "boring." For example, when the apple logo is not pressed, all the faces will have the "meh" emoji face. However, when the mouse is pressed, meaning that the apple is given to the people, they will become happy. I tried to show how people immediately change to happy when using modern technology.

 **Dream Space Adventure**<br>
 Our idea is that people go to the Galaxy to travel and explore. Because this project is going to be a surreal world, we have found a dreamy image for the background. People take a flying(bouncing) sailboat, avoiding some obstacles, a mirage (B&W door), the shooting stars, and a floating planet. Find the right door (pink door) that opens the new world. Move the mouse while clicking the mouse to see the hidden planets and the doors that rotate with each other.

This page shoes how information spread online nowadays. If I click anywhere on the page, the circle increases. It means how the information spreads to a wide range and every person have choice to spread information.

**Gotenks's Super Volley Ball Adventure**<br>
"Gotenks's Super Volley Ball Adventure" is Josh and Stephen's recreation of one of our favorite scenes in Dragon Ball Z. In the scene, Gotenks (the character representing your mouse) has turned the main villain into a volleyball, and proceeds to play with said ball. We felt like it represented the very best of Dragon Ball, demonstrating the sheer power of the characters, while staying fun and playful.

To represent this scene in code, we made the ball slowly bounce around the screen. When Gotenks "powers up" (in this case, clicking the mouse,) he visually transforms into his more powerful super saiyan 3 form, and also physically "gets stronger" in that the volleyball gets faster. And of course, the longer he stays as a super saiyan 3, the faster the ball gets. As a final easter egg, if you get too close to Piccolo, the mentor character, he scolds Gotenks for messing around.

**Untitled**<br>
In this code art, I am experimenting how is the bouncing ball in p5 works, and involved the code online as a sample and edit it to the way I want, so it is like a window screensaver I used to know back in the day. I changed and added the images from class exercise, and apply a sound effect in the mousePressed(), so every time I pressed the mouse, there is a sound. After knowing how the concept and p5 works, I plan to put it into my final project as part of the interaction of my net art project.

**CRRF**<br>
This piece explores the use of the Square Image practice that we did during class. Although what it does is really simple, I wanted to know how it would work as a kind of interactive reveal/sneak-peak. I used my own characters to experiment with the square image coding. When you mouse over either of them, there is a "sneak-peak" of who they really are behind their human disguise. I faded the images that cover the background so that it vaguely reveals what is behind each one. I've already completed Rokai's(upper-left) and Calypse's(upper-right) true forms. I haven't thought up of what Rai's(bottom-left) and Ferro's(bottom-right) true forms should look like; there are only eye silhouettes in place of what they truly look like. It took me several months to come up with Rokai's and Calypse's. So considering the time constraint, I wouldn't have been able to think up fast enough of what Rai and Ferro look like without their human disguises. I also need to practice drawing wolves and tigers, since I mostly draw dragons.

**Mary and Jesus**<br>
"Mary and Jesus" is created in response to the actions taken against innocent adolescents, action that involve the separation of kids from their parents in the southern border. It is a commentary on the diaspora that uses christianity to justify it use of force for the "protection of the southern border".

I wanted to add these photos that are close-ups to show emotions from being at in a state of 'awe' to 'fury'.

**Distance**<br>
 In this piece, I am exploring the dynamics of human relationships through the balls which represent individuals and their interactions with one another. The biggest question I am trying to explore is "How close is too close?"

**Flight Log**<br>
Flight Log is about how much I flew back home this school year. In total, I flew back 7 times, 4 times last year and 3 times this year. The 14 planes represent the planes that took me from San Jose to San Diego and vice versa.  I'd like to keep this project updated; everytime I fly and go back to San Diego, I'll add a new pair of planes.

**Prince of Tennis ._.**<br>
I just tried to experiment with the mouse-pressed coding and the sound coding, I hope to get better at this for the final project, but I just used to to recreate a time i hit my friends camera while he was filming.
