<p>Art 74 Assignment</p>
The concept of my video is based on the transition from loud to soft. There are many sounds that overwhelm us, so it's good to find a quiet place for yourself.

<p>The concept for my video was to be able to create the feeling of walking down the street in an urban neighborhood. I tried to immerse the audience through the use of sounds and visuals that one might hear in an everyday stroll.</p>
<br>
**Henry Fisher**:

This concept is based on my recent experiment being stuck in the elevator. I wanted to emulate what I felt and what it was to experience that situation.

<p>A &quot;light&quot;-hearted experiment with premiere pro</p>
The video concept began with finding a 3D printer with a flashing light. From there, I layered scenes I filmed around the Art Department and audio from my sound art project and an old High school Japanese project. To make the picture more interesting, I used chromatic aberration and opacity changes.

# Group Two

**Derek Fung:**
<br>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/321867495" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This video explores the uniformity of everyday in college and touches on the stress that comes from the many responsibilities that comes from having to support yourself while in school.</p>
<br>

**Kaicong Tang:**
<br>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/321835639" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This project is just about a tryout by combining audio and video together. On the video, I combine many 4-10 second short video together and play around with the transition effects. I have this idea from some social media where people play their short video with transition effects, and it looks very cool. So, I try the similar way in this vdieo.</p>
<br>
**Khoa Tran:**
<br>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/321656874" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></p>
My video was just me having some fun with my friends. We are into cars and we decided that it would be cool if i recorded them and their cars.
<br>

**Shannon Gonzalez:**

<p>In life people tend to move at a fast pace; we&#039;re always working or always in a rush to get somewhere that life passes right before our eyes. We don&#039;t often pay attention to small aspects and we need to slow down. To convey this idea, I combined several videos that are both at a fast pace and a slow pace with subtle audio to match.</p>
<br>
**Seraiah West:**
<br>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/321695878" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This is a video montage of videos from my instagram/snapchat stories of my friends being their dumb selves and making me laugh. They&#039;re really the only reason why I like to visit my home town and I like to capture the funny moments we spend together.</p>
<br>

# Group Three

**Francisco Mendoza:**

<p></p>
Jaded.
The video is about the feeling one gets when they are high on a drug. I distorted the video as well as the audio to create a psychedelic look and sound. The fall at the end is a representation of the after effects of taking a drug. It's all fun and games until you get hurt.
<br>

**Josh Santiago**:

Half Empty. is a film dedicated to capturing motion. It's about the contradiction of rapid stillness, the juxtaposition of prolonged motion, and the permanence of a spill versus the fleeting nature of consumption.

This is a video of a cup's adventure, but it undergoes a big problem. This video is a preview based video.
<br>

# Group Four

<br>
**Yanrong Li:**
<br>

<p></p>
The soundtrack I made were like rainy days under the wind, and I made a water reflection world video according to this. It rained until the rain stopped.
<br>
<br>

<p>A bird comes out from the painting in the school&#039;s gallery.</p>

<p>Name: N&aring; Da<br />
The concept is to explore the possibilities of what kind of emotions combining sound and video from Californa whit memories from the past will produce.&nbsp;<br />
It is footage from campus, sound form campus and video taken of my Christmas tree hunt.</p>
<br>


# Group Five

**Mohamed Husain:**
<br>

<p></p>
It's simply a look into the average environment of a state university. The sound art I used involved tapping on objects, which actually fit with the first scene in the computer lab as it sounds similar to keyboard tapping, and registers which fit with the third scene which involved the Student Center. Ultimately, it was a simple glimpse to college life.
<br>
<br>
**Patti Silva:**
<br>

<p></p>
For this project I wanted to capture my experience of going to and art event. The audio I included and the choppy, kind of shaky clips are intended to make it seem more realistic and somewhat like replaying a memory in your head.

This video is about the juxtaposition between two of my many realities. The desire to support the healing of the Earth and the sensory overload of the beautiful amongst the not so beautiful events that are taking place. I chose to focus more specifically on waste management in the world. Trash not disappearing (non degradable) and trash that disappears into the ocean. Almost two thirds of landfill waste is biodegradable. This waste rots and decomposes, and produces harmful gases (CO2 and Methane) which are both greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming. There are many environmental, social, and cultural issues that have abetted in posing harm to the Earth and its inhabitants. This is just one interpretation that I have on this subject.

<p>&quot;Hide Out&quot; is a video based on the concept of my own inner battle with dealing with grief and being physically separated from the place where I needed to be instead of at school: home. The audio was all recorded at my family&#039;s home in Fairfield, while the video footage was taken here on campus. The flashing images of my grandma and the audio represented my inner thoughts while being here at school during this time of sadness.</p>

This video explores the concept of endless work and being free. In this generation, students are often stacked with too much work and we have no time for freedom or relaxation of mind. It would be nice for us to have time to clear our minds once in a while and step outside.
