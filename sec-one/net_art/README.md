<p>The title of our piece is The Gallery. Our project concept is about Data as Self Portrait. We wanted to find everything on the internet that represented ourselves. For our home page, we first found images that seem cohesive together to make it aesthetic, which was black and white. After that, we branched off to our own individual pages and created programs that showed who we are.</p>

# Group Two

**Seraiah, Lilly, and Shannon**

<p>This website is a representation of our group's combined memories of our first online games. The home page of the website is a representation of the online game ToonTown and how the game play was experienced. This page leads to the other two pages represented as Toon Tasks, The Bejeweled page represents the beloved game of Bejeweled, a classic game many people have played as their first game. The 123 part of the web page is supposed to represent the feeling of having endless possibilities, in choosing a game. Adiktied to finding the best one of them.</p>

<p>Self-portraits<br>
Our project is about self-portraits. Our net art shows our hobbies and personality. Also, we both like the light color, so we decided to use blue as the first-page background. Our concept of the Net Art is to show viewers about our world. There is a computer where set on the first page, we want people to click it and across the computer to our world However, we have limited technique skill. We put some gifs in our net art and try to show the lively visually appealing. For the next page, the background was created by Yanrong.</p>

I wanted to express myself but not showing the information of myself. Usually if we pressed the "see more" button, we could see the information about what we want to know. I set the page which says "the information was deleted" because personally I don't like to remain the information I searched or picture I took on my devise. The advertisement we see on website is made based on our personal research but I don't really like it because it makes me feel I am controlled or I analyzed.


# Group Six

**Hector and Henry**

<p>What we have done is create a fake data-broking website that aims at selling user data to other companies and individuals. There are hundreds of these sites online, but they aren't very transparent with how this information is shared or collected. The aim of this project was to shed light on these practices through the visualization of these websites. Not only does this site tackle the idea of sites who profit from user data, but companies as well. Major companies like Google and Microsoft build profiles just like the one seen on our site, but it's not advertised to be that way. Google's source of income is through user data, no different then our website.
<br>
Our "Company" Mission (For the Site):
Henry Fisher and Hector Mendoza started the Personal Information Index, or PI², because they were tired of seeing people's data not properly being utilized in making user's lives catered to their needs. With modern-day data collection, hundreds of companies have access to infinite information about every citizen without a central way to control it--making the information near useless.
<br>
That's why Henry and Hector set out to create a revolutionary new platform in which data collection and selling is not only more transparent than ever, but also centralized and easy to manage from one place. Companies interested in buying data can browse the PI² website and find any information they need, and when ready, can easily check out a person's information through our secure, encrypted servers. We pride ourselves in only holding 100% factual information on every individual, and the most in-depth of any service to ever exist--as we compile information from hundreds of other data brokers.
<br>
Through the Personal Information Index’s revolutionary new method of data commerce, we want to help companies and individuals more effectively use other's data to better benefit society as a whole. For only $19.99, you can purchase any individual's private information without their knowledge, click our Profiles tab to get started on your first purchase!
<br>
For larger purchases, send an email to PII@PII.io for bulk account queries (Max 1 million accounts)"</p>

<p>Explore Art with Heart
<br>
Data as self portrait, Explore art with heart, meaning art has to be felt in order to be expressed. A symbol of a heart written with data "rose" to express how
you do things with love and triangular shapes to complete the art piece to show how things put together can create a full art piece of its own. Exploring GIF to show how we create new pieces from everything. I can relate to this piece as a self portrait because art makes me happy, it is a form I like to use to express what I would like others to feel when they see my work.</p>

# Group Nine

<p>This website is a project based on my earliest memories on the internet. In this case, I've created an art gallery designed to invoke similar themes to the popular art site DeviantArt, which was at its height during the 2000s when I was growing up.</p>

# Group Ten

<p>"Olivia Teracash"<br>
The concept of our project was to give an ambient feel to the blog page, but at the same time make it seem like a normal regular blog site that someone stumbles upon. Once clicking into or out of the piece, the blog page gets interestingly creepy and ominous.</p>
