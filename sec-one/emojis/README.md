**Description:** Pugs are planning a global takeover of cuteness. So, I am proposing a pug emoji because I am pretty sure that the average person mentions the word "pug" at least ten times on a normal day......
The pug emoji should be placed in between the red heart and the purple heart because one look and they steal your heart <333333

The hair trimmer is the tool that most hair stylists use nowadays and even though the scissors haven't become obsolete, the hair trimmer is what comes to mind when most people think of a haircut.
