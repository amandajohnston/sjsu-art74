# Course Description
This course will explore fundamental concepts and methods of digital media art production. It provides an introduction to digital art, web presentation techniques, and digital based fabrication. We shall explore both conceptually and technically what it means to manipulate images and create objects digitally; we will explore digital spaces and experience social and physical overlap of media. This course is a visual art course and will approach media from a fine art and theoretical perspective. Students will produce artworks using currently available imaging, composition, web design, and other software. Projects will be presented digitally and on the web. The class will focus on current methods, trends, and conceptual frameworks for artistic production involving contemporary technology. The course emphasizes creative and critical thinking, problem solving, and computer literacy.<br>


# Course Expectations
**Attendance and Behavior**<br>
Show up to class, and show up on time. Students are expected to be present and conduct themselves professionally. Attendance and participation are crucial to your success in this course. If you need to miss a class ahead of time, please let me know as soon as possible- in person and via email- as well as what you plan to do to make up the missed work and when you will turn it in. Please find two classmates who will be your support system (and vice versa) for the class and can fill you in if you need to miss class and/or troubleshoot with you when you are stuck.<br>

This is a hands on course, and an openness and willingness to learn is key. Itâ€™s not a software training course, but you will be given introductions to several applications and techniques. Learning these programs can be challenging so it is important to have a flexible attitude and to remain open to new things to achieve your goals. Creating digital media art (or any kind of art) can often be a non-linear, multi-platform, exploratory, and both individual and shared experience. Use your patience, curiosity, intellectual interests, honest experience, and what engages you most, to guide you. <br>

**Respectful Behavior & Technology Policy**<br>
Respect is an essential part of the class community. During lectures, group discussions, critiques, and during lab time, students are expected to be respectful. This includes not using their phones, taking naps, or talking to others outside of class context. Answering your phone, texting, and web browsing during lectures, critiques, discussions, or demos is unacceptable. You are welcome to use your electronic devices for class purposes. Students who cannot honor these requirements will be asked to leave. In the case that phone use becomes prevalent and disruptive, we will experiment with a phone stack. <br>

**Communication**<br>
Communication is an important part of this class. Be honest and clear about your work, about where you are in your work, about challenges you are experiencing. Please bring up issues before they become larger. I am available outside of class at office hours or by appointment.

**Readings, Discussions**<br>
There will be short reading assignments related to the course content. We will have some class and Canvas discussions about the material. Simply reading the material is not enough, it is expected that you to communicate your thoughts in class and Canvas submissions.<br>
<br>
**Participate**<br>
We value your skills, experience, and interests. Your views are important and we want to hear them. Involvement in the readings, discussions, and critiques are part of your participation grade and critical for each student and the class to thrive.

**Field Trips & Guest Speakers**<br>
We may be going offsite as a class at least once, and attending this field trip is a part of your participation grade. In addition, we may have guest speakers. Showing attention and respect is also a part of your grade.

**Computer Use**<br>
A computer is mandatory to make work for this class. If you do not have a computer or the software outlined earlier in this syllabus, you have access to the CADRE computer labs and the University computers to complete your work.
