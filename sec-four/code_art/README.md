**The Maze**<br>
My piece is called 'the Maze'. Users use their mouse to hovering over the path. Once they reach the center of the maze, they click the mouse and they see a surprise. After the center of the maze is clicked, the game starts over.

**Warm and Cool**<br>
My code art project features the same city scape but with two different atmospheres. The interactive element gives the viewer the choice between making the scene night or day. This is coupled with the fact that there is a moving sun and moon. This adds a mini game element where the viewer can switch the time of day when the sun or moon rises or sets. This makes the project more narrative; you can imagine time passing in this imaginary place and you can control when the day is over.

**Chasing Point Butterfly**<br>
“What do we really want to pursue? The original intention at the beginning, or the fascinating prosperity in front of us?”

Butterfly: fame and name<br>
Orange Dot: original intention<br>
Black dot: us<br>
Gray dot: nothing last<br>

**Luna y Sol**<br>
 It is a collaborative piece between Carla and Noah. The concept for this piece was to incorporate movement and interaction between the moon and sun over two different backgrounds.

 **Who's there**<br>
I turned the mouse into a pair of eyes which should be placed on the sculpture. Once you place them on, the sculpture will change and seek for you.

 **Protect your eyes, otherwise...**<br>
People who ever has eye prescription must see this pic. Since we were young, the elder people always talks next to us protect your eyes; don't look into the screen for too long; look far; go to the nature, look into some green staff, etc. Of course, I pretend I listen to them in order to sustainable development... Therefore, press the mouse...

I wanted to express where my mind desire to go when I am in a lot of stress. My mind is in somewhere else on the planet, but academic. When you click the image, there is me collapsing on the floor, wish this semester could be over already. The inner me is screaming help for all the big assignments that I have to do as the end of semester is approaching.

**Airplane**<br>
I made an airplane flying on a bright sunny day when mouse click the weather will change to a dark rainy day. The sun will become the moon, and the star and rain will show.

**Plumber**<br>
It is inspired and created to salute one of the most important games in the history: Super Mario. I created the background and pipes using rectangles. And I use ps to create the character and images that I need. I used "if...else..." to add some different moves for Mario: jump if the mouse is pressed and hold if the mouse is released.  

I tried to use what I have learnt to rebuild this old game scene in my memory.

**On Fire**<br>
On Fire is a fun, animated, and interactive artwork that shows my very first experience with coding. It's slightly related to my last Net Art Project, which I used the same sky-related concept to create a fun story.

**Stress Bomb**<br>
Recently I stress by many things surrounding me, it inspired me to created this project and trying to reduce some stress. In this project, I load the image that I prepare in the photoshop. Then use mouse clicked function to interact with the viewer.

**CAREFUL**<br>
The title of our piece is a cheeky comment about the invasion and loss of privacy on the internet. The combination of title "CAREFUL" and the text BIG BROTHER IS ALWAYS WATCHING" serves as a warning to the audience.
The art piece involves the movement of the mouse across the screen and experiencing the glitching search engine homepage. Each glitch represents an alphabet soup agency and search engine corporation collecting information about you.
When you click down on the mouse button the background explodes into a hostile red with Big Brother from Orwell's 1984 stating you are always being watched.

**Circle Party**<br>
The concept of this was to make something simple and yet random all at the same time, I wanted to add more but limitation prevented me from doing so.

**THE DND DISASTER**<br>
Just like Bob Ross makes his own landscapes paintings, I make D&D characters. Each of the pictures are a different character I play or I made to be either NPCs or future characters I would like to play. Behind every creation is a creator however and when you press on the mouse the mastermind is revealed.
