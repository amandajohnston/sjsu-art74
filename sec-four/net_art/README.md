Title: Negative Utopia

The concept is internet dystopia masquerading as a utopia (the internet provides many benefits that simultaneously hinder us in many other aspects). Our net art website's purpose is to express our interpretation/prediction of the impact that the progression of the internet will have on society.

# Group Three

**Mandy and Effy**

We chose the early internet memory, and simplified pages, used vapor wave images to illustrate nostalgic emotions to the childhood memory.

# Group Four

**David and Mary**

Location Tracker<br>

Location Tracker is a piece that portrays movement data based on different transportation methods. Most of our phones have location services, and specifically Google records this data so you can see where you have been. The purpose of the project is to represent a single person's life of travel based on what choices they make to travel, effectively a self-portrait.

# Group Five

**Guoxun and Yingshi**

In this project, "Memory". we had created a web page inspired by our earlier internet memories. It's a combination of earlier chatting environment we used and the classic pixel game. The style we made is base on the experience at that time period. Such as the text, screen, button, sound and border style. Also the thing with many "errors".

# Group Six

**Carla and Noah**

Our concept was inspired by the Yahoo Pool game of the early 2000s. We customized it to make it relevant to our identities and community. We envisioned Queer Pool a place where friendships could be built. It serves as some of our early internet memories and a fictional chatroom.

# Group Seven

**Vanessa, Ray, and Thomas**

Our Net Art Piece is called Windows Story. The concept of our project is based around the theme of early internet memories. We thus decided to start our piece with an old Windows XP login/startup page that would link to a Maplestory Game Launcher (from the Windows home page). Once the game is "launched," the game continues to tell a story as if one were playing the Maplestory game itself. The concept is quite simple, but hopefully we were able to capture some early memories of the early 2000s!


# Group Eight

**Alex, Annie, and Xin**

We originally wanted a web sight where there would be multiple doors and if one where to be clicked then some sort of animated figure would pop out and head for another random door. However seeing as how we didn't have the correct information to implement something like this to our web sight, we also had limited time to work on it. So we just had to settle for less and make a very basic and simple design. It wasn't the most ideal vision that we decided on, but in the end, it some how worked together.

# Group Ten

**Bri**

My Childhood in Mockbuster Form<br>

My project was to keep it as simple as I could with the limited amount of skills I have. The home page introduces you to two options, one being a picture show of what I Googled and Youtubed as a child, the second a more physical short paragraph description of my childhood with the Internet.

# Group Eleven

**Sabrina**

Title: Self Portrait <br>
I thought it would be cool to how I was perceived by the internet given my search/browser history. Some ads are accurate while others are not but I still consider it a portrait of my internet self.
