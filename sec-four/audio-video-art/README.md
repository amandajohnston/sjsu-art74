"Late nights"
For my piece I focused on the bright colored street lights and sounds that came from a night drive. I boosted the color saturation and blurred the focus in and out of clips. I used glitch for my transitions and effects, while distorted some of the sound so that it was almost like static.

In the blue waters, a little bit of light shattered, the reflection is the mysterious deep dream of the sea weaving.

<p>The concept of my video was to capture outside shots specifically at night, accompanied by the sounds of relaxing noise. My goal was to keep my video as simple as possible, with the intention of it being both visually and auditorily relaxing/pleasing, or maybe even therapeutic. I kept all the shots at night so that it&#039;d be visually easy on the eyes, and I used the sounds of windchimes (from my house), the wind, and water falling to sound pleasant to the ear (or at least I hope it does :p) hehehe</p>

Hello!

I made this video with recordings from different places around the Peninsula. Places include Portola Valley, Page Mill Road, SJSU, and Menlo Park.

I was able to record audio of wind, water, and my sister blasting music from the other room I was working in. In order to make the audio my own, I heavily edited and processed all the music.

I was having trouble "concluding" my film so I decided on just having everything rewind almost.

# Group Three

**Guoxun Wu:**

<p>The concept behind this project is inspired by my own emotion during waking up in the morning. I usually start with very quiet when I open eyes, then more and more things enter my brain and push me to wake up. It reminds me the feeling of unexpected, confused and unknowing. Also recently I am making watercolor painting, I really like the fantastic and dreamlike tones of it. Then I use ink in water to create this particular feeling because when the ink drops in water it becomes an unexpected shape. The light background and water sound help emphasis this concept as well.</p>

We have always been moving forward, and it is easy to ignore the people and things behind us. I make this video to remind people not to ignore the people around them.

# Group Four

**Bri Felix:**

So I gave this project a literal title. I wanted it to feel like, "Oh here is an Overwatch play of the game and then all of sudden you're transported to another dimension where a girl is now dancing to distortion???" Only to cut to my dog, Mikey (the best actor, truly deserves an Oscar), but the rest of the play is happening in the background. It is supposed to be confusing. There is no literal meaning, no plot, and none of the videos or the audio is related to each other. I wanted to leave you confused. Enjoy!!!

I found it relaxing to drive during the evening, especially when it was stormy earlier. I chose a ticking sound to represent a constant repetitiveness to driving.

<p>The idea behind it is to switch between reality and the pattern in the video is hallucination. I mixed the videos&#039; audios together for the background music. It expressed the struggle of facing between reality and dreaming because feels better being in an illusion.</p>

# Group Five

**Effy Junhan Wang:**

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/321421390" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>A flash of everything.</p>

"25" is a conceptualization my emotions about a traumatic event that took place the day before my 25th birthday. In the audio, I included myself reading aloud journal entries and poetry about the incident including audio that exemplifies my healing journey. My goal was to create a visual experience that is stylistically simplistic accompanied with audio that is more complex and multilayered.

**Noah Sesmas**:

The concept for Nostalgic Dreams was about coming to terms with my OCD tendencies. I tend to replay moments/memories in my mind constantly throughout my days and this video/audio I created represent these thoughts and emotions.

It is a description of two emotions of myself: Peace and Fidget. I shoot two videos and put it together in one image. The comparing of these two opposite emotions turn out to be interesting and attracting.
